## Introduction

Inspired by the Minimalism documentary on Netflix, I wanted something that helped declutter my room by tracking what I actually do and don't use. I decided to start with my closet first. This app was born, focused on helping track and prep you for [Project 333](https://bemorewithless.com/project-333/).

## How to Use

1. The app has a fixed navbar and a fixed bar at bottom that pops open on hover:

2. Hover over this footer allows a reference point for users on the whats, how and why of the app. It'll sit unobstrusively at the bottom of the page and out of the way otherwise.
3. Clicking Add in the nav allows users to add an outfit they wore that day, and the occason they wore the items for:

4. Clicking Outfit in the nav sends a request to list all the outfits worn so far, with the most recent on top. This is also the page that users would use to delete and edit/update outfits:

## In Progress

Add Passport.js for separate user functionality. Create an outfit search engine, or figure out a better way to display outfits. Create charts to dynamically update stats. This is the current placeholder under the Stats section:
